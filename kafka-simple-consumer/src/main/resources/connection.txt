Based on the two images showing your Oracle UCP (Universal Connection Pool) configuration, here's a detailed explanation of each parameter:
Connection Factory & Basic Configuration
1. CONNECTION_FACTORY_CLASS_NAME: "oracle.jdbc.replay.OracleDataSourceImpl"

Specifies the data source implementation class for creating connections
Using OracleDataSourceImpl enables Application Continuity and Replay features
This class supports transparent application failover and request replay capabilities

2. DB_Reference: "Oracle"

A logical name/identifier for this database connection configuration
Used for referencing this specific database configuration in the application

3. PROTOCOL: "tcp"

Network protocol used for database communication
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is the standard protocol for Oracle database connections

4. POOL_NAME: "JDBC_BASE"

Unique identifier for this connection pool instance
Used for monitoring, management, and distinguishing multiple pools in the same application


Pool Sizing Parameters
5. MIN_POOL_SIZE: 15

Minimum number of connections maintained in the pool at all times
Connections are created eagerly up to this number during pool initialization
Even during idle periods, the pool will never shrink below this size
Your setting: 15 connections always ready

6. MAX_POOL_SIZE: 15

Maximum number of connections allowed in the pool
Note: Your min and max are the same (15), creating a fixed-size pool
This means no dynamic scaling - always exactly 15 connections
Consideration: This prevents pool growth under load; ensure 15 is sufficient for peak usage

7. INITIAL_POOL_SIZE: 15

Number of connections created when the pool is initialized
Your setting: All 15 connections are created at startup
Benefit: Eliminates connection creation latency during application startup
Trade-off: Slower application startup but faster first requests


Connection Availability & Timeout Parameters
8. CONNECTION_WAIT_TIMEOUT: 5 (seconds)

Maximum time a thread will wait for an available connection
If all 15 connections are in use, requesting threads wait up to 5 seconds
After 5 seconds, throws SQLException if no connection becomes available
Consideration: With a fixed pool of 15, this could cause failures under high load

9. INACTIVE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT: 30 (seconds)

Time a connection can remain idle (checked out but not used) before being reclaimed
Helps prevent connection leaks from applications that forget to close connections
After 30 seconds of inactivity, UCP can reclaim and return the connection to the pool
Best Practice: This is your safety net against connection leaks

10. TIME_TO_LIVE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT: 120 (seconds)

Maximum lifetime of a connection from creation to forced closure (2 minutes)
Connection is closed and removed from pool after 120 seconds, regardless of activity
New connection is created to maintain pool size
Purpose:

Prevents stale connections
Helps with database load balancing
Ensures connections don't hold resources indefinitely



11. ABANDON_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT: 60 (seconds)

Time after which a borrowed connection is considered abandoned
If a connection is checked out for more than 60 seconds without activity, it's marked as abandoned
Different from INACTIVE: This applies to borrowed connections that appear leaked
Helps identify and recover from connection leaks

12. TIMEOUT_CHECK_INTERVAL: 5 (seconds)

Frequency at which UCP checks for timeout violations
Every 5 seconds, the pool maintenance thread runs to:

Check for inactive connections
Check for abandoned connections
Check connection time-to-live
Enforce timeout policies


Lower values: More responsive timeout enforcement, slightly higher overhead
Your setting: Good balance between responsiveness and performance


Connection Reuse & Recycling
13. MAX_CONNECTION_REUSE_TIME: 600 (seconds - 10 minutes)

Maximum time a connection can be reused before being closed
After 10 minutes of cumulative use (not idle time), connection is closed
Forces connection recycling to prevent resource exhaustion
Benefits:

Prevents memory leaks in JDBC driver
Ensures fresh connections periodically
Helps with cursor and session state cleanup



14. MAX_STATEMENTS: 25

Enables statement caching with a cache size of 25 prepared statements per connection
Total cached statements: 15 connections × 25 = 375 statements maximum
Benefits:

Reuses prepared statements instead of re-parsing SQL
Significant performance improvement for repetitive queries
Reduces database CPU load


Trade-off: Increased memory usage per connection


High Availability & Failover
15. FAST_CONNECTION_FAILOVER_ENABLED: true

Enables Oracle Fast Connection Failover (FCF) for RAC environments
UCP receives notifications from Oracle RAC when nodes fail
Automatically removes failed connections and redirects to healthy nodes
Requirements:

Oracle RAC or Active Data Guard
ONS (Oracle Notification Service) configuration


Benefits: Near-instant failover without application awareness

16. VALIDATE_CONNECTION_ON_BORROW: true

Tests connection validity before handing it to the application
Executes a lightweight validation query (typically ping)
Benefits:

Prevents applications from receiving dead connections
Catches network failures, database restarts


Trade-off: Slight latency on each connection acquisition
Your setup: With FCF enabled, this provides extra safety


Architecture Analysis
Your Configuration Profile: Fixed High-Availability Pool
Strengths:

✅ Predictable performance - Fixed 15 connections, no scaling delays
✅ High availability - FCF enabled for RAC failover
✅ Connection quality - Validation on borrow prevents stale connections
✅ Statement caching - 25 statements/connection improves performance
✅ Leak protection - Multiple timeout mechanisms prevent resource exhaustion
